My CodeIgniter template
=======================

My development stack looks like this:

* OpenBSD
* nginx
* php-fastcgi
* CodeIgniter (current version in this template is: 2.1.0)

Setup
-----

Install nginx and php-fastcgi:

	$ sudo pkg_add nginx php-fastcgi

Clone this repository as starting point:

	$ git clone git://github.com/bnadland/codeigniter_template.git my_new_project

Now change into the new project:

	$ cd my_new_project

Edit nginx/nginx.conf:

	user bnadland;

	[...]
	location /user_guide {
		root /home/bnadland/codeigniter_template/;
		index  index.html;
	}
	[...]

Change the user directive to the user you're developing with and change the 
root directive to the my_new_project directory.

Development
-----------

Start nginx:
	
	$ sudo nginx -p nginx -c nginx.conf 

Start php-fastcgi:

	$ php-fastcgi -b 127.0.0.1:9000 index.php

Write your code as usual in the application directory.
